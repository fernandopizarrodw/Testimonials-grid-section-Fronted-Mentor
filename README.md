## 🚀 What I Learned

Through this challenge, I reinforced my understanding of CSS Grid and how to manage custom layout adjustments using `grid-column` and `grid-row` for responsiveness. I also practiced structuring reusable card components with flexible text areas.

## 🔄 Continued Development

I'd like to improve how I handle content width without hardcoding values and continue exploring better ways to create adaptive layouts that don't rely heavily on pixel widths.
